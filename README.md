# GAMs-Cetacean-Dataset
Code script used, under R software, for modelling the data bias of an open-source cetacean occurrence dataset (https://dx.doi.org/10.14284/547), specifically on: i) the number of sightings recorded per survey and ii) the identification success.

The CETUS dataset contains effort-based occurrence records collected during a cetacean monitoring programme in the Eastern North Atlantic, since 2012.
